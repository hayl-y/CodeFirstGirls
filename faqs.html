            <p class="bold_text">How are students invited to the ceremonies?</p>
            <ul>
              Schools confirm to the Academic Registry department which students are eligible to graduate. Eligible students are invited in line with the government guidelines (for the summer or winter ceremonies) via their University email account. No invitations are issued by post. It is therefore imperative that students keep their contact details up to date and regularly check their email or they may miss the opportunity to attend their graduation ceremony.
              
              The email will provide further details, directing them to the NTU graduation website for more information and to confirm attendance. </ul>

            <p class="bold_text">Do I have to wear academic dress?</p>
            <ul>Yes, you will not be allowed to join the ceremony unless wearing full academic dress. Graduation is a formal event all students should dress as if they are attending an interview. We also recommend bringing some hair grips to secure your hat and safety pins for your hood.</ul>
            <p class="bold_text">How do I order a gown?</p>
            <ul>You can order your robe from our website once you have received your official NTU invitation. It is your responsibility to ensure you obtain the correct academic dress.</ul>
            <p class="bold_text">Where is the collection and drop-off point for gowns and hoods?</p>
            <ul>You can collect your gown from the Registration Venue. You will drop-off your gown in the Newton Hall. Stewards will be able to direct you on the day.</ul>
            <p class="bold_text">What should I wear under my gown?</p>
            <ul>Your graduation is a ceremonial event and formal dress is customary. All students are expected to wear a gown, hood and hat with smart clothing underneath such as a suit or dress, as if you are attending an interview.</ul>
